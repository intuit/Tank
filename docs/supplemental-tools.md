# Supplemental Tools

Tank includes several external/supplemental tools that can be used in conjunction with it for a comprehensive load testing experience.

??? tip "Tip: Navigating to the Tools page"
    Clicking the `Tools` tab takes the user to the main screen, which has links to `downloads` (AND) pages for launching the tools as `java applets`.

There are two sections of links for the tools, `Applets` and `Downlaodable` Tools.

## Java "Applet" Tools
Applets are rich clients that are run using `Java Applet` technology.   
They access system resources, and so they are signed using a `self-signed certificate`. This would mean you will be prompted to trust the applet when you launch it.
